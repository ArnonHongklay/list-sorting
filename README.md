# Clinic Listing Page

Cerrita has a growing list of clinics on the website. See Bangkok clinics  link (https://www.cerrita.com/search-form.php?l=Bangkok&t=&ct=Dental&search=advanced)  as an example. Currently, there is no option for the user to sort it in other ways like on other websites. The clinic sorting order (which clinic shows first, second, etc.) are manually arranged by a person. 

There are better ways to sort clinics to benefit the user and our business. Hence, we want you to:
1. Identify at least 4 methods that the clinic list can be sorted
2. Select one method you recommend to set as a default setting, explain your reasoning. Identify variables and factors that you included in the sorting algorithm.
3. Define how you would measure the success rate of this sorting algorithm. What metrics should be use to judge and how do you track it.

Please use the data and content made available to you from the link above and rearrange the clinics according to your recommended sorting.

Submission guidelines : Answers and explanations to questions 1-3 are to be answered in written form. The sorting method algorithm should be coded with data inputs and desired output. The solution should be submitted with all source code, optional build scripts, and a README.txt file with instructions on how to run the application (including any required dependencies).
